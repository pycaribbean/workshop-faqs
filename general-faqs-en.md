# General FAQs

## Who can attend the event?

Everybody is welcomed without exeptions. That being said this workshop assumes that you're familiar with the Python language or at very least with general programming. 

We also require that minors be accompanied by their legal guardians.

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

The venue has ample parking. Additionally the Cupey train stop is a five minute walk away.

## What should I bring to the event?

You should bring your own computer with Python 2.7 or 3.5 and Falcon installed. To install Python and Falcon please take a look at the following links: 

* [Installing Python](https://github.com/pycaribbean/workshop-faqs/blob/master/installing-python-en.md)
* [Installing Falcon](http://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/install.html)

You should also have a text editor of your choice to follow the examples. It is prefferable that you have a code editor such as Atom or Sublime Text since they will give you extra functionality like code highliting and autoindentation. This makes coding that much easier.

## Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?

You can contact the organizers at: [froilan@pycaribbean.com](mailto://froilan@pycaribbean.com) or [@skfroi](https://twitter.com/skfroi) on Twitter

## Is my registration/ticket transferrable?

Not really. We would appreciate some notice if you can not attend after recerving a ticket.

## Will there be snaks/food/refreshments available?

We will not be providing any food during the event. If you wish you can bring any snacks you wish.

There is a filtered water fountain in the room that everybody can use. We will provide cups for everybody but by all means bring water bottles if you'd like.

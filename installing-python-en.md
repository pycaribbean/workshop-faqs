# Installing Python

We strongly recomend that Python 3 is used. That being said Python 2.7 is still usable with this workshops. None of the workshops exercises will be specific to a Python version.

## Windows

Python.org provides a number of MSI downloads for Windos. You can get them [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Once the download is finished, run the MSI and follow the installer's instructions.

## Mac OsX

Mac OsX 10.8 and up has Python 2.7 installed out of the box. If you want to update or install a new Python version please read: [Using Python on Macintosh](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)

You could also install Python using a package manager sush as [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

### E.g.

Python 2.7.x

```
$> brew install python
```

Python 3.x

```
$> brew install python3
```

## Linux

Most Linux distros already have a version of Python installed. To verify this you can type the following command: ```$> python --version```

If by any chance you do not have Python installed you should use your distro's package manager to installed the desired Python version.
